# This file should be in your Rails app config folder, or for script / non Rails app be accessible
# by your app
# different host / port can be used to split the different usage
# Redis is mono threaded so the same server can also run different instances on different ports
# session can be separate for different group of applications
# You need one separate file for each hsdq class
# below setup for 2 instances of Redis:
# - port 6379 with 2 databases (message db 1 and admin db 0)
# - port 6380 for session
# any app/script/class that need to exchange messages together should share the same setup, it is
# strongly suggested to use same setup for all apps at the beginning.
# The flexibility of this setup file is for scaling and sharding the busses.
